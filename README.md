# SimpleCaptcha - Jakarta

A Java library for creating CAPTCHAs for Jakarta EE applications,
including Spring MVC, Struts, and Grails.

Example implementations are located in the examples/ directory. The more robust
examples were done using Grails; this is the recommended starting point for
learning how to implement and use SimpleCaptcha.

To build, simply run ant from this directory.
